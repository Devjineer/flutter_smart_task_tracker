# SMART TASK TRACKER

This project is to solidify concepts I have learnt so far on flutter. And this will stamp me as certified **Junior Flutter Developer**

## 🎯 What I’ll Build

A Task Tracker app where users can:

- See a list of tasks
- Mark tasks as Completed / Pending
- See task priority (High / Medium / Low)
- Toggle task status
- Navigate between screens
